# UD for Mundurukú 

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In general, words are delimited by whitespace characters. Description of exceptions follows.
* According to typographical rules, many punctuation marks are attached to a neighboring word. We always tokenize them as separate tokens (words);
* There are no adjectives in Mundurukú. Modification is made by composition, so when a lexical root is modified by another a new word appears as in *kuɲãporaŋ* (*kuɲã* 'woman' + *poraŋ* 'beauty'). Such words are treated as [multiword tokens](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html#morphological-annotation).



## Morphology

### Tags

This is an overview only. For more detailed discussion and examples, see the list of [Mundurukú POS tags](pos/index.html) and [Mundurukú features](feat/index.html).

* Mundurukú uses 16 ofthe 17 universal POS categories. ADJ is not used since there is no separate class of adjectives. Stative-verbs and adjectives behave alike, in a way that is not possible to distinguish them morphologically (I am ugly / I have uglyness; ugly boy / boy with uglyness).


### Nominal Features

* Nominal words ([NOUN](), [PROPN]() and [PRON]()) have an inherent [Gender]() feature with one of three values: `Masc`, `Fem` or `Neut`.
  In some cases the masculine gender is further subclassified by the [Animacy]() values `Anim` and `Inan`.
  Feminine and neuter nominals do not distinguish animacy grammatically.
  * The following parts of speech inflect for `Gender` and `Animacy` because they must agree with nouns: [ADJ](), [DET](), [NUM](),
    [VERB](), [AUX](). For verbs (including auxiliaries), only participles and converbs inflect for gender. Finite verbs don't.
* The two main values of the [Number]() feature are `Sing` and `Plur`. The following parts of speech inflect for number:
  [NOUN](), [PROPN](), [PRON](), [ADJ](), [DET](), [VERB](), [AUX]() (finite, participles and converbs), marginally [NUM]().
  * Remnants of the `Dual` number occur only in the instrumental [Case]() of a few nouns and all the agreeing parts of speech.
  * Selected nouns are plurale tantum (`Ptan`) or singulare tantum (`Coll`). These two values are lexical and cannot be used with
    the agreeing adjectives, determiners or verbs. They also never occur with pronouns.
* [Case]() has 7 possible values: `Nom`, `Gen`, `Dat`, `Acc`, `Voc`, `Loc`, `Ins`.
  It occurs with the nominal words, i.e., [NOUN](), [PROPN](), [PRON](), [ADJ](), [DET](), [NUM]().
  It can occur with participles but only with those tagged as `ADJ`. It never occurs with verbs.
  * The `Case` feature also occurs with prepositions ([ADP]()). Here it is a lexical feature. Prepositions do not inflect for case
    but they subcategorize for the case of their noun phrase.

### Degree and Polarity

* [Degree]() applies to adjectives ([ADJ]()) and adverbs ([ADV]()) and has one of three possible values: `Pos`, `Cmp`, `Sup`.
* [Polarity]() has two values, `Pos` and `Neg`, and applies primarily to verbs ([VERB](), [AUX]()), adjectives ([ADJ]()) and adverbs ([ADV]())
  that can be negated using the bound morpheme _ne-_.
  * Occasionally _ne_ occurs as an independent negation particle ([PART]()) and is marked with `Polarity=Neg`.
  * Negating nouns is usually limited to those derived from verbs _(neúspěch, nedůvěra, nevydávání)_ but in principle every noun can be negated.
  * The `Polarity` feature is not used with pronouns and determiners, although there is a subset of negative pronouns and determiners.
    The `PronType=Neg` feature is used there instead.

### Verbal Features

* kake AUX	v:ex
* opop	AUX	aux

* Verbs have a lexical [Aspect](), either imperfective (`Imp`) or perfective (`Perf`). A few verbs are biaspectual and they lack the `Aspect`
  feature. Some imperfective verbs could be further classified as iteratives but they are not marked as such (although UD provides `Aspect=Iter`).
  * The `Aspect` feature should be also used with the corresponding derived nouns and adjectives (participles), if they have the
    `VerbForm` feature.
* Finite verbs always have one of three values of [Mood](): `Ind`, `Imp` or `Cnd`. The conditional mood is only used with conditional
  auxiliaries _(bych, bys, by, bychom, byste)_. The l-participle of the main verb, that is needed to form a periphrastic conditional,
  is not marked with this feature.
* Verbs in the indicative mood always have one of three values of [Tense](): `Past`, `Pres` or `Fut`.
  Note that `Tense=Pres` is also used with forms of perfective verbs, which are formally present, but semantically future.
  Hence both _jdu domů_ “I am going home” and _přijdu domů_ “I will come home” end up marked as `Tense=Pres`.
  On the other hand, a few imperfective verbs can form a genuine future form using prefixes, and they are marked `Tense=Fut`:
  _půjdu domů_ “I will go home”.
  * Imperative and conditional forms do not have the `Tense` feature (note that past and present conditionals are distinguished
    analytically).
  * The `Tense` feature is also used to distinguish present and past converbs (_dělaje_ “while doing” vs. _udělav_ “having done”),
    and present and past participles (_dělající_ “doing” vs. _udělavší_ “having done”).
    The l-participle (tagged `VERB` or `AUX`) also has `Tense=Past` because its primary function is to form the past tense.
    The passive participle does not have the `Tense` feature.
* There are two values of the [Voice]() feature: `Act` and `Pass`. Only the passive participle has `Voice=Pass`. All other verb forms have
  `Voice=Act`.

### Pronouns, Determiners, Quantifiers

* [PronType]() is used with pronouns ([PRON]()), determiners ([DET]()) and adverbs ([ADV]()).
* [NumType]() is used with numerals ([NUM]()), adjectives ([ADJ]()), determiners ([DET]()) and adverbs ([ADV]()).
* The [Poss]() feature marks possessive personal determiners (e.g. _můj_ “my”),
  possessive interrogative, indefinite or negative determiners (e.g. _čí_ “whose”),
  possessive relative determiners (e.g. _jehož_ “whose”)
  and possessive adjectives (e.g. _otcův_ “father's”).
* The [Reflex]() feature marks reflexive pronouns _(se, si)_ and determiners _(svůj)_.
  In Czech it is always used together with `PronType=Prs`.
* [Person]() is a lexical feature of personal pronouns ([PRON]()) and has three values, `1`, `2` and `3`.
  With personal possessive determiners ([DET]()), the feature actually encodes the person of the possessor.
  Person is not marked on other types of pronouns and on nouns, although they can be almost always interpreted as the 3rd person.
  * As a cross-reference to subject, person is also marked on finite verbs ([VERB](), [AUX]()).
* There are two [layered features](../../u/overview/feat-layers.html), [Gender[psor]]() and [Number[psor]]().
  They appear with certain possessive adjectives and determiners and encode the lexical gender/number of the possessor.
  The extra layer is needed to distinguish these lexical features from the inflectional gender and number
  that mark agreement with the modified (possessed) noun.
